## cherry-o

A pico-8 shmup created with [pico-8 education edition](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/) following [lazy devs' tut](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3Sfq4XJqNVbd1vsWnh7LZd) 

`game*.lua` tabs are devoted to the game and are tightly coupled with `main.lua`. The other tabs are meant to be more independent and provide utilities for special effects (`fxs.lua`, `starfield.lua`) and intermediate states (`screen*.lua`).

## pico-adventure

An exceedingly small three-level game to pick up a sword and defeat the enemy/enemies roaming the makeshift room. Created with [pico-8 education edition](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/).
